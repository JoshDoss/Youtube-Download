Concept: Download videos from youtube 
	- download videos from playlists on profile
		- only download new videos added to playlist since last run
	
	- download individual videos to specific folders

Modules:
	- pytube
	- argv from sys : take arguments from commmand line ex. the link to the video to be downloaded

Workflow:
    - Pass argument index postion [1] from terminal 
    - Assign parent directories
    - check if url is to a playlist or video: Youtube urls currently contain "watch?" or "playlist?" to denote a video or playlist respectively
    Playlists
        - check for and create sub directory in parent dir with playlist title as directory name if not already existing
        - store the names of any files that exist in the playlist directory
        - iterate across pytube Playlist.vidoes object
        - genreate file name with shared convention for each video: at this step replace any characters that are illegal for file names that are in viedo titles
        - check if video from playlist shares a name that has been stored: skip download if a match is found
        - save videos to [parent directory]\\[Playlist title]\\[[video title] from [channel name]]
        - timeout after 60 seconds and move onto next video
